OVERVIEW
--------

This source code provides an implementation of VBM3D developped in "Dabov, Kostadin,
Alessandro Foi, and Karen Egiazarian. "Video denoising by sparse 3D transform-domain
collaborative filtering." 2007 15th European Signal Processing Conference. IEEE, 2007".

This code is part of an [IPOL](http://www.ipol.im/) publication. Plase cite it
if you use this code as part of your research ([link](https://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2021/340/)).

It is based on Marc Lebrun's code for the image denoising version of this algorithm (BM3D)
available on [the BM3D IPOL page](http://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2012/l-bm3d/).
It also uses the TVL1 optical flow from IPOL ([here](http://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2013/26/), available 
in the folder 'tvl1flow') and the multiscale from [here](https://github.com/npd/multiscaler)
(in the folder 'multiscale').

COMPILATION
-----------

The code is compilable on Unix/Linux and hopefully on Mac OS (not tested!). 

**Compilation:** requires the cmake and make programs.

**Dependencies:** FFTW3 and OpenMP [can be disabled]. 
For image i/o we use [Enric Meinhardt's iio](https://github.com/mnhrdt/iio),
which requires libpng, libtiff and libjpeg.
 
Configure and compile the source code using cmake and make.  It is recommended
that you create a folder for building:

UNIX/LINUX/MAC:
```
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

Binaries will be created in `build/bin folder`.

NOTE: By default, the code is compiled with OpenMP multithreaded
parallelization enabled (if your system supports it). 
The code will then use the maximum number of thread available on your machine (up to 32). 
This can be reduced by changing the maximum number of threads allowed in lines 126 and 127 
of `vbm3d.cpp`.

USAGE
-----

The following commands have to be run from the current folder:

List all available options:</br>
```
$ ./VBM3Ddenoising --help
```

While being a video denoising algorithm, the method takes as input the frames of the video 
and not an actual video. The frames can be extracted using ffmpeg on linux. For example: 
```
$ ffmpeg -i video.mp4 video/i%04d.png
```

There is only four mandatory input arguments:
* `-i` the input sequence
* `-f` the index of the first frame
* `-l` the index of the last frame
* `-sigma` the standard deviation of the noise

When providing a sequence that is already noisy the option `-add` should be set to false.

All path should be given using the C standard. For example to reference to the following video:
* video/i0000.png
* video/i0001.png
* video/i0002.png
* video/i0003.png
* video/i0004.png
* video/i0005.png
* video/i0006.png
* video/i0007.png
* video/i0008.png
* video/i0009.png

The command for denoising with a noise standard deviation of 20 should be 
```
$ ./VBM3Ddenoising -i video/i%04d.png -f 0 -l 9 -sigma 20
```

This creates a basic denoised sequence (bsic_*.png) and a final denoised sequence (deno_*.png).
It also create a text file (measure.txt) with the respective PSNRs and RMSEs (when -add is set to True).

The denoising with optical flow can be called using the `VBM3Ddenoising_OF.sh` script:
```
$ ./VBM3Ddenoising_OF.sh video/i%04d.png 20 deno_%03d.tif 1 9
```

Similarly the multiscale denoising can be called using the `VBM3Ddenoising_multiscale.sh` script. The following
command performs a denoising with two scales (DCT version) with the default VBM3D parameters: 
```
$ ./VBM3Ddenoising_multiscale.sh video/i%04d.png 20 test deno_%03d.tif 1 9 "" 2 0
```

Finally the multiscale denoising with optical flow can be called using the `VBM3Ddenoising_OF_multiscale.sh` script:
```
$ ./VBM3Ddenoising_OF_multiscale.sh video/i%04d.png 20 test deno_%03d.tif 1 9 "" 2 0
```
